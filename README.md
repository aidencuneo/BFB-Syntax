# BFB Syntax README

Syntax highlighting for BFB (Brainf*** but Better).

This is a pretty simple extension, so I don't think I'll be updating this much
(if at all).

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial release.

### 1.0.0

First proper version of BFB Syntax.

### 1.0.1

Bug fixes :)

### 1.0.2

Fixed a bug where for loops would have some whacky highlighting inside their
declarations. Also removed variable syntax highlighting (eg: x = 5) because
it felt kind of pointless and it was messing up other things anyway.
